abstract = {Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a well-known family of nature-inspired metaheuristics used to find approximate solutions for challenging optimization problems. Despite its relative simplicity and adaptability to new problem variants, the efficiency of ACO significantly deteriorates with increasing problem size, even though it often provides high-quality solutions. This paper aims to enhance the performance of ACO when solving large instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Specifically, we propose novel improvements to the current state-of-the-art ACO approach, Focused ACO (FACO), that include a node relocation procedure applied during the solution construction process and a greedy heuristic that preserves high-quality solutions from previous algorithm iterations. Our proposed FACO variants demonstrate a substantial performance improvement when solving TSP instances with up to 200k nodes.}

abstract = {Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based meta-heuristic inspired by the social behavior of ants. It is successfully applied in solving many NP-hard problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Large-sized instances pose two memory problems to the ACOTSP algorithm: the memory size and the memory bandwidth. This work has focused on developing ACOTSP-MF, a new ACOTSP algorithm proposed to adequately manage the memory issues that arise while solving large TSP instances. ACOTSP-MF uses the nearest neighbor list, introducing a novel class of cities, the backup cities, while grouping cities into three classes: the nearest neighbor cities, the backup cities, and the rest of the cities (the majority). ACOTSP-MF also modifies how the base ACOTSP carries out the tour construction and pheromone update phases depending on the group to which a city belongs. This way, ACOTSP-MF reduces both the memory requirements of its data structures (from O(n∗n) to O(n)), and the memory bandwidth needs (thanks to better exploitation of the memory data locality). In this paper, we have carried out an in-depth analysis of ACOTSP-MF performance for medium and large TSP instances, covering vectorization and scalability issues and showing its main bottlenecks. For medium-size instances, the paper reports speedup factors of 20-500X for the rl11849 instance compared to the base ACOTSP version. ACOTSP-MF is intended and especially adequate for large-size instances. In this context, the paper reports excellent execution time for the Tour Construction phase, with less than 500 ms per iteration for the earring-200k instance. Finally, a study about the solution quality of ACOTSP-MF has been included, showing that ACOTSP-MF paired with local search offers high solution quality (within 2% of the best-known solution).}

Our method first leverages Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to amortize a multi-modal prior distribution over combinatorial solution space that encompasses both high-reward and diversified solutions. This prior is iteratively updated via parallel stochastic search in the spirit of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), leading to the posterior distribution that generates near-optimal solutions. Extensive experiments across seven combinatorial optimization problems demonstrate GFACS’s promising performances.}

  abstract = 	 {Learning-based algorithms to solve TSP are getting popular in recent years, but most existing works cannot solve very large-scale TSP instances within a limited time. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a creative and distinctive method to select and locally optimize sub-parts of a solution. Concretely, we design a novel framework to generalize a small-scale selector-and-optimizer network to large-scale TSP instances by iteratively selecting while optimizing one sub-problem. At each iteration, the running time of sub-problem sampling and selection is significantly reduced due to the full use of parallel computing. Our neural model is well-designed to exploit the characteristics of the sub-problems. Furthermore, we introduce a trick called destroy-and-repair to avoid the local minimum of the iterative algorithm from a global perspective. Extensive experiments show that our method accelerates state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms more than 2x while achieving better solution quality on large-scale TSP instances ranging in size from 200 to 20,000.}

These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},
