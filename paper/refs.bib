abstract = {Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a well-known family of nature-inspired metaheuristics used to find approximate solutions for challenging optimization problems. Despite its relative simplicity and adaptability to new problem variants, the efficiency of ACO significantly deteriorates with increasing problem size, even though it often provides high-quality solutions. This paper aims to enhance the performance of ACO when solving large instances of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Specifically, we propose novel improvements to the current state-of-the-art ACO approach, Focused ACO (FACO), that include a node relocation procedure applied during the solution construction process and a greedy heuristic that preserves high-quality solutions from previous algorithm iterations. Our proposed FACO variants demonstrate a substantial performance improvement when solving TSP instances with up to 200k nodes.}

abstract = {Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a population-based meta-heuristic inspired by the social behavior of ants. It is successfully applied in solving many NP-hard problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Large-sized instances pose two memory problems to the ACOTSP algorithm: the memory size and the memory bandwidth. This work has focused on developing ACOTSP-MF, a new ACOTSP algorithm proposed to adequately manage the memory issues that arise while solving large TSP instances. ACOTSP-MF uses the nearest neighbor list, introducing a novel class of cities, the backup cities, while grouping cities into three classes: the nearest neighbor cities, the backup cities, and the rest of the cities (the majority). ACOTSP-MF also modifies how the base ACOTSP carries out the tour construction and pheromone update phases depending on the group to which a city belongs. This way, ACOTSP-MF reduces both the memory requirements of its data structures (from O(n∗n) to O(n)), and the memory bandwidth needs (thanks to better exploitation of the memory data locality). In this paper, we have carried out an in-depth analysis of ACOTSP-MF performance for medium and large TSP instances, covering vectorization and scalability issues and showing its main bottlenecks. For medium-size instances, the paper reports speedup factors of 20-500X for the rl11849 instance compared to the base ACOTSP version. ACOTSP-MF is intended and especially adequate for large-size instances. In this context, the paper reports excellent execution time for the Tour Construction phase, with less than 500 ms per iteration for the earring-200k instance. Finally, a study about the solution quality of ACOTSP-MF has been included, showing that ACOTSP-MF paired with local search offers high solution quality (within 2% of the best-known solution).}

  abstract = 	 {Learning-based algorithms to solve TSP are getting popular in recent years, but most existing works cannot solve very large-scale TSP instances within a limited time. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a creative and distinctive method to select and locally optimize sub-parts of a solution. Concretely, we design a novel framework to generalize a small-scale selector-and-optimizer network to large-scale TSP instances by iteratively selecting while optimizing one sub-problem. At each iteration, the running time of sub-problem sampling and selection is significantly reduced due to the full use of parallel computing. Our neural model is well-designed to exploit the characteristics of the sub-problems. Furthermore, we introduce a trick called destroy-and-repair to avoid the local minimum of the iterative algorithm from a global perspective. Extensive experiments show that our method accelerates state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms more than 2x while achieving better solution quality on large-scale TSP instances ranging in size from 200 to 20,000.}

abstract = {This article presents a general class of associative reinforcement learning algorithms for connectionist networks containing stochastic units. These algorithms, called REINFORCE algorithms, are shown to make weight adjustments in a direction that lies along the gradient of expected reinforcement in both immediate-reinforcement tasks and certain limited forms of delayed-reinforcement tasks, and they do this without explicitly computing gradient estimates or even storing information from which such estimates could be computed. Specific examples of such algorithms are presented, some of which bear a close relationship to certain existing algorithms while others are novel but potentially interesting in their own right. Also given are results that show how such algorithms can be naturally integrated with backpropagation. We close with a brief discussion of a number of additional issues surrounding the use of such algorithms, including what is known about their limiting behaviors as well as further considerations that might be used to help develop similar but potentially more powerful reinforcement learning algorithms.},

abstract = {Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), as a classic routing optimization problem originally arising in the domain of transportation and logistics, has become a critical task in broader domains, such as manufacturing and biology. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been increasingly employed to solve TSP due to its high inference efficiency. Nevertheless, most of existing end-to-end DRL algorithms only perform well on small TSP instances and can hardly generalize to large scale because of the drastically soaring memory consumption and computation time along with the enlarging problem scale. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end DRL approach, referred to as Pointerformer, based on multi-pointer Transformer. Particularly, Pointerformer adopts both reversible residual network in the encoder and multi-pointer network in the decoder to effectively contain memory consumption of the encoder-decoder architecture. To further improve the performance of TSP solutions, Pointerformer employs a feature augmentation method to explore the symmetries of TSP at both training and inference stages as well as an enhanced context embedding approach to include more comprehensive context information in the query. Extensive experiments on a randomly generated benchmark and a public benchmark have shown that, while achieving comparative results on most small-scale TSP instances as state-of-the-art DRL approaches do, Pointerformer can also well generalize to large-scale TSPs.},

  abstract = 	 {Learning-based algorithms to solve TSP are getting popular in recent years, but most existing works cannot solve very large-scale TSP instances within a limited time. To solve this problem, this paper introduces a creative and distinctive method to select and locally optimize sub-parts of a solution. Concretely, we design a novel framework to generalize a small-scale selector-and-optimizer network to large-scale TSP instances by iteratively selecting while optimizing one sub-problem. At each iteration, the running time of sub-problem sampling and selection is significantly reduced due to the full use of parallel computing. Our neural model is well-designed to exploit the characteristics of the sub-problems. Furthermore, we introduce a trick called destroy-and-repair to avoid the local minimum of the iterative algorithm from a global perspective. Extensive experiments show that our method accelerates state-of-the-art learning-based algorithms more than 2x while achieving better solution quality on large-scale TSP instances ranging in size from 200 to 20,000.}
